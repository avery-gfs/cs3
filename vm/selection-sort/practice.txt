-- Sort the 10 values in memory using the selection sort algorithm.
-- You should use reference.py as a reference for the algorithm.
-- You can hard-code the length of the memory into the program.

-- One of the challenges you'll face is the limited number of registers;
-- you can solve the problem using 4 registers, but you'll have to be
-- careful with how you use them. I'd recommend using two registers for
-- the two memory indices (i and j in the python program), and the other
-- two registers for storing temporary values. Remember that you can always
-- re-load values from memory if you need.
